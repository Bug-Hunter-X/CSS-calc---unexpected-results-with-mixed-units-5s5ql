The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, using `calc()` with a percentage and a unit other than pixels (like `em` or `rem`) can sometimes lead to unexpected results. This is because the percentage is calculated relative to the parent element's content width, while the other units are relative to the font size or the root element size.  This mismatch in calculation contexts can lead to layout issues.
